# Experiment 2

## Title
Product of Array Except Self

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that:

- `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.
- Do not use the division operator.
- Solve the problem in **O(n)** time.

---

## Approaches Implemented

### 1. Brute Force
- For every element, multiply all the remaining elements.
- Store the product in the answer array.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`

**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

---

### 2. Prefix & Suffix Arrays
- Compute the prefix product for every index.
- Compute the suffix product for every index.
- Multiply both values to get the final answer.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

**Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

---

### 3. Optimal (Prefix Array + Right Variable)
- Store only the prefix products in the output array.
- Traverse from right to left using a single variable `right`.
- Multiply the prefix product with the running right product.

**Time Complexity:** `O(n)`

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (excluding the output array)
